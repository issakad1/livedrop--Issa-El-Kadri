To combat this, Shoplite employs a multi-layered defense system that blends technology, strict policies, and human oversight.\n",

If a product is not delivered, is misrepresented, or is discovered to be counterfeit, buyers are eligible for a full refund. Payments are closely monitored with AI-driven fraud detection systems that flag suspicious transactions in real time. Examples include unusually high-value purchases, bulk orders of the same product from new accounts, or inconsistent delivery addresses. In such cases, buyers may be asked to verify their identity through one-time passcodes or additional authentication steps.\n",
